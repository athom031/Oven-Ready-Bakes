### Website Tutorial Start

**Install needed Software**

- Code Environment - [VS Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Node.js
    - It's possible you already have node, try running this in your command line:
        `npm -v`
      If that code gives you back a version number then you have some version of node on your laptop. We use `npm` a lot in react it's just a bunch of packages and already existing libraries that have been uploaded to give u less hassle. (Ex: how to take ur repo and locally host a website, how to build it, how to search other projects people have worked on to use in urs, etc).
    - If you don't have npm when you run that code, you can go through the download process [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - Even if you have downloaded it, it's possible that you don't have latest version of npm so run this again in command line: `npm install -g npm`
