### Website Tutorial Start

**Install needed Software**

- Code Environment - [VS Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Node.js
    - `npm` is used a lot in react. It's basically just a bunch of packages that are already out there for you to use rather than you having to do it yourself. We use `npm` to run someone else's work that manages locally hosting your website, building it for production, or just a neat project/API someone else has made.
    - It's possible you already have node, try running this in your command line:
        `npm -v`.
        - If that code gives you back a version number then you have some version of node on your laptop. ie:
        ```
        thomaalex@thomaalex-mbp Oven-Ready-Bakes % npm -v
        9.6.7
        ```
    - If you don't have npm when you run that code, you can go through the download process [HERE](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - Even if you have downloaded it, it's possible that you don't have latest version of npm so run this again in command line: `npm install -g npm`
